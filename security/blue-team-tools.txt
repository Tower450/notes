- ioc_finder : Simple, effective, and modular package for parsing observables (indicators of compromise (IOCs), network data, and other, security related information) from text. It uses grammars rather than regexes which makes it more readable, maintainable, and hackable.

        from ioc_finder import find_iocs
        text = "This is just an foobar.com https://example.org/test/bingo.php"
        iocs = find_iocs(text)
        print(iocs['domains'])  # ['foobar.com', 'example.org']
        print(iocs['urls'])  # ['https://example.org/test/bingo.php']
