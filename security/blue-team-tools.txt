- dnstwist: Domain name permutation engine for detecting homograph phishing attacks, typo squatting, and brand impersonation

    Usually thousands of domain permutations are generated - especially for longer input domains. In such cases, it may be practical to display only the ones that are registered. Ensure your DNS server can handle thousands of requests within a short period of time. Otherwise, you can specify an external DNS server with --nameservers argument.

        dnstwist --registered domain.name

## ioc (indicator of compromise)

- ioc-fanger: Fang and defang indicators of compromise.

        import ioc_fanger

        ioc_fanger.defang("example.com http://bad.com/phishing.php")  # example[.]com hXXp://bad[.]com/phishing[.]php
        ioc_fanger.fang("example[.]com hXXp://bad[.]com/phishing[.]php")  # example.com http://bad.com/phishing.php

- ipgrep: Extract, defang, resolve names and IPs from text

    https://github.com/jedisct1/ipgrep

- ioc_finder : Simple, effective, and modular package for parsing observables (indicators of compromise (IOCs), network data, and other, security related information) from text. It uses grammars rather than regexes which makes it more readable, maintainable, and hackable.

        from ioc_finder import find_iocs
        text = "This is just an foobar.com https://example.org/test/bingo.php"
        iocs = find_iocs(text)
        print(iocs['domains'])  # ['foobar.com', 'example.org']
        print(iocs['urls'])  # ['https://example.org/test/bingo.php']

## operative systems

- inotify-tools is a C library and a set of command-line programs providing a simple interface to inotify.

        # monitor all files in folder for changes
        $ inotifywait -m -r --format '%w%f %e' -e modify /tmp/test/
        /tmp/test/toto6 MODIFY

    https://github.com/inotify-tools/inotify-tools

- lsof: list open files

        $ cat > /tmp/LOG &
        cat > /tmp/LOG &
        [1] 18083
        $ lsof -p 18083
        lsof -p 18083
        COMMAND   PID   USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE  SIZE/OFF     NODE NAME
        cat     18083 yamato    1w   REG   0,44         0 54550934 /tmp/LOG

        # monitor inotify files
        $ lsof -n | grep inotify
