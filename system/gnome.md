# Touchpad tap

To see what is set:

    synclient

The keys: TapButton1 (one finger), TapButton2 (two fingers), TapButton3 (three fingers) have values: left-click (1), middle-click (2) and right-click (3).

Inverse actions done with two to three fingers:

    synclient TapButton2=3
    synclient TapButton3=2

# Gnome gdm login background

The only one that worked for me on Arch Linux:

    sudo -u gdm dbus-launch gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.screensaver picture-uri 'file:///usr/share/backgrounds/gnome/picture.jpg'
Then, you can verify it worked:

    sudo -u gdm gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.screensaver picture-uri

Or verify using dconf:

    sudo -u gdm dconf read /org/gnome/desktop/screensaver/picture-uri

# Gnome-terminal profiles

* Backup current

    dconf dump /org/gnome/terminal/ > org.gnome.terminal

* Nuke current

    dconf reset -f /org/gnome/terminal/

* Load yours

    dconf load /org/gnome/terminal/ < org.gnome.terminal

# NetworkManager

## MAC Randomization during Wi-Fi scanning is crashing the connection

This is a very weird bug. I have two laptops using ArchLinux with Gnome Shell both are using same packages versions. One could connect to the University network and the another one couldn't. After investigation, I found that something was failing related to MAC address as seen in below log. Turns out that desactivating MAC boundcing during a connection solved my issue.

**Logs:**

    $ journalctl -rxt NetworkManager

**Solution:**

    $ cat /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf 
    
    [device]
    wifi.scan-rand-mac-address=no

    [connection]
    wifi.cloned-mac-address=stable

This configuration is demonstrated in the [ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NetworkManager#Configuring_MAC_Address_Randomization) and it is explained in depth on [gnome blog post](https://blogs.gnome.org/thaller/2016/08/26/mac-address-spoofing-in-networkmanager-1-4-0/).
