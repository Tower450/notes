## reconnnaissance

- The SNMP protocol is a stateless, datagram oriented protocol. An SNMP scanner is a program that sends SNMP requests to multiple IP addresses, trying different community strings and waiting for a reply. Unfortunately SNMP servers don't respond to requests with invalid community strings.

## privilege escalation

- Local Privilege Escalation tool, from a Windows Service Accounts to NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. RottenPotatoNG and its variants leverages the privilege escalation chain based on BITS service having the MiTM listener on 127.0.0.1:6666 and when you have SeImpersonate or SeAssignPrimaryToken privileges. During a Windows build review we found a setup where BITS was intentionally disabled and port 6666 was taken.
