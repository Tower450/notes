# suid (set user id)

> when a command or script with suid bit set is run, its effective uid becomes that of the owner of the file, rather than of the user who is running it

    # set it
    chmod 4555 <file>
    ls -lrt <file>

    # find them
    find / -user root -perm -4000 -print 2>/dev/null
    find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
    find / -user root -perm -4000 -exec ls -ldb {} \;

## privilege escalation
    
    bash -p -i  # -p is critical
    
    nmap --interactive
    !sh

# guid (set group id)

> sgid permission is similar to the suid permission, only difference is – when the script or command with sgid on is run, it runs as if it were a member of the same group in which the file is a member

    # set it
    chmod g+s <dir>
    chmod 2555 <file>

    # find them
    find / -perm -g=s -type f 2>/dev/null

– the setgid permission displays as an "s" in the group’s execute field
- if lowercase letter "l" appears in the group’s execute field, it indicates that the setgid bit is on, and the execute bit for the group is off or denied

# sticky bit

> shared directories such as /var/tmp and /tmp because users can create files, read and execute files owned by other users, but are not allowed to remove files owned by other users

    # set it
    chmod +t <dir>
    chmod 1777 <dir>

- T refers to when the execute permissions are off.
- t refers to when the execute permissions are on.
