# lateral movement

Network Lateral Movement, or simply "Lateral Movement", refers to the techniques that cyber folks use to progressively move through a network as they search for the key data and assets that are ultimately the target of their attack.

## regeorg: http tunnel

ReGeorg acts as a HTTP proxy to tunnel data in and out of a network. It is used to bypass firewall policy that only allows HTTP traffics. ReGeorg can transport other TCP sessions such as RDP, SSH, and SMB through the HTTP tunnel. ReGeorg is an upgraded version of ReDuh. The ReGeorg server script is often installed by attackers after a web server is compromised.
