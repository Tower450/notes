## reconnnaissance

- The SNMP protocol is a stateless, datagram oriented protocol. An SNMP scanner is a program that sends SNMP requests to multiple IP addresses, trying different community strings and waiting for a reply. Unfortunately SNMP servers don't respond to requests with invalid community strings.

## evasion

- Takes a binary as input and splits it until it pinpoints that exact byte that Microsoft Defender will flag on, and then prints those offending bytes to the screen. This can be helpful when trying to identify the specific bad pieces of code in your tool/payload.

## privilege escalation

- Local Privilege Escalation tool, from a Windows Service Accounts to NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. RottenPotatoNG and its variants leverages the privilege escalation chain based on BITS service having the MiTM listener on 127.0.0.1:6666 and when you have SeImpersonate or SeAssignPrimaryToken privileges. During a Windows build review we found a setup where BITS was intentionally disabled and port 6666 was taken.

- Kernel Forge consists from two main components: the first library implements main functionality required to call an arbitrary kernel functions and the second library used to delegate arbitrary memory read write primitives: it can be local privileges escalation exploit or just some wrapper around 3-rd party WHQL signed loldriver. For this project I'm using WinIo.sys variation that provides full physical memory access and works just fine even with enabled HVCI:
